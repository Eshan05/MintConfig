This is my configuration of Linux Mint (Cinnamon 21.3). Effectively, it's a more customized version of the rice done by [LinuxScoop](https://youtu.be/h1yIY1BwetQ).  I have added/modified `rofi`, `Shina Firefox`, `gnome-terminal`, `conky` and the base theme and `cinnamon.css` to some extents to achieve the final product below:

The conky files are from [here](https://github.com/Kosteron/Conky). It's best to get them yourself and configure it for your screen & device. The rofi (Eariler) files are from [here](https://github.com/catppuccin/rofi). For firefox, go to Shina Firefox and follow their guide, then import `tabliss.json`

There is no dock.
